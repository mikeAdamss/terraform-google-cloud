# terraform-google-cloud

A collection of terraform scripts I use for interacting with google cloud services.

Mainly intended as an exercise is setting up a cloud based platform from scratch.

## Usage

Once you've run `/setup/setup.sh` you'll need to have the google credentials exported into
your environment to run terraform with any of the included terraform scripts.

`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - i.e the path to your credentials json

`GOOGLE_PROJECT` - your project name
